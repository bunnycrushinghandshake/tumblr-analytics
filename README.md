# Tumblr Community Analytics
An ongoing project to build a fun analytics package for whatever corner of tumblr you call home.

# Game Plan
The plan right now is to develop and share several un-linked funtions that each provide meaningful insights into the workings of a tumblr community. The different functions will be self contained enough that anyone can download them, change the key varaibles, and run the function (provided the have the proper external libraries installed).
A goal far down the road is to integrate this all into one analytics interface. This is far FAR down the road.
